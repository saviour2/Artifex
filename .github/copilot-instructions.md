- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created. (Created 17 Nov 2025)

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements
      (User requested new Next.js + Tailwind "Repair Manual Realism" UI in Artifex.)

- [x] Scaffold the Project (create-next-app with Tailwind, TS, ESLint, React Compiler, npm alias @/\*)

- [x] Customize the Project (Restored Artifex flow with Auth0 gate, describe/upload form, Gemini-driven guide output)

- [x] Install Required Extensions (No extensions recommended by tooling, so none installed.)

- [x] Compile the Project (`npm run build` verified without errors)

- [x] Create and Run Task (Not required; npm scripts are sufficient for this workflow.)

- [x] Launch the Project (`npm run dev` running locally; stop with Ctrl+C when finished.)

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete (README refreshed, instructions cleaned.)

- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.
